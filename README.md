# Advertising Campaign ROAS Optimizer

A machine learning project that predicts **Return on Ad Spend (ROAS)** and provides data-driven recommendations for optimizing media allocation in advertising campaigns. Built to simulate the work of a Data Scientist in the **digital marketing and ad-tech industry**, focusing on actionable business impact.

---

## ðŸ“Œ **Project Overview**
Advertising campaigns often waste budget on low-performing segments. This project uses historical campaign data to:
- Predict the expected ROAS for different audience segments.
- Recommend optimized budget allocations.
- Simulate the impact of these changes using **A/B testing**.

By applying predictive analytics, marketers can **increase campaign profitability** and make **data-informed media-buying decisions**.

## ðŸ›  **Features**
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleans and prepares campaign data for modeling.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Uses regression algorithms (e.g., Linear Regression, XGBoost) to estimate ROAS.
- **Model Evaluation**: Measures performance using RÂ², MAE, and cross-validation.
- **Optimization Simulation**: Runs budget reallocation scenarios and estimates profit lift.
- **Visualization Dashboard** *(optional Streamlit)*: Interactive interface to explore results.

---

## ðŸ“Š **Results**
- Achieved a **+18% simulated ROAS lift** through optimized budget allocation.
- Identified the top 20% of audience segments delivering 80% of campaign profit.
- Demonstrated how **A/B testing** validates optimization impact.
