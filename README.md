# ðŸ“Š Advertising Campaign ROAS Optimizer
[![GitHub release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/chibuogwuonyemaechi/advertising-roas-optimizer?color=blue&label=Release)](https://github.com/chibuogwuonyemaechi/advertising-roas-optimizer/releases/tag/v1.0)

A machine learning project that predicts **Return on Ad Spend (ROAS)** and provides data-driven recommendations for optimizing media allocation in advertising campaigns.  
Built to simulate the work of a Data Scientist in the **digital marketing and ad-tech industry**, focusing on actionable business impact.

## ðŸ“¢ Release Notes â€“ v1.0
**Date:** 2025-08-09  
**Summary:** First complete release of the Advertising Campaign ROAS Optimizer project.

### Changes:
- Added full EDA section with univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis.
- Implemented three regression models: Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost.
- Added automatic best model saving (`best_model.pkl`).
- Included prediction demo that runs with a sample dataset.
- Created `sample_advertising_data.csv` for GitHub demo usage.
- Updated `.gitignore` to allow sample data and exclude large/real datasets.
- Polished README.md with professional project structure and usage guide.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
Advertising campaigns often waste budget on low-performing segments.  
This project uses historical campaign data to:
- Predict the expected ROAS for different audience segments.
- Recommend optimized budget allocations.
- Simulate the impact of these changes using **A/B testing**.

By applying predictive analytics, marketers can **increase campaign profitability** and make **data-informed media-buying decisions**.

---

## ðŸ›  Features
- **Data Pre-processing**: Cleans and prepares campaign data for modelling.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis with visualizations.
- **Predictive Modelling**: Uses multiple regression algorithms (Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost) to estimate ROAS.
- **Model Evaluation**: Measures performance using RÂ², MAE, and cross-validation.
- **Optimization Simulation**: Runs budget reallocation scenarios and estimates profit lift.
- **Visualization Dashboard** *(optional Streamlit)*: Interactive interface to explore results.
- **Prediction Demo**: Uses the saved best model to make predictions on new campaign data.
